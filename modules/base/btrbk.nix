  # Btrbk configuration for single-disk setup
  # Logic: Creates local snapshots and stores "backups" in a separate
  # subvolume on the same physical drive.

  # Usage:
  #   1. btrbk will create snapshots on schedule
  #   2. we can use `btrbk run` command to create a backup manually

  # How to restore a snapshot:
  #   1. Find the snapshot you want to restore in /snapshots
  #   2. Use `btrfs subvol delete /btr_pool/@persistent` to delete the current subvolume
  #   3. Use `btrfs subvol snapshot /snapshots/2021-01-01 /btr_pool/@persistent` to restore the snapshot
  #   4. reboot the system or remount the filesystem to see the changes
  #
